Rails 4.2 example application that integrates Rails and Bootstrap 3.3.

"Bootstrap":http://getbootstrap.com/ (formerly Twitter Bootstrap) provides CSS stylesheets and JavaScript code for the visual design of websites. Bootstrap is a framework for client-side (browser-based or “front end”) development, much like Ruby on Rails is a framework for server-side development.
